# Cipher - Devloped for COP4020 Summer 2018 - University of Central Florida
Using Haskell to develop a program that can crack most Caesar ciphers<br>
Public functions <br><br>
encode int string<br>
The first parameter is how far you want to shift your string 1-25; The second is the plaintext you want to encode<br>
decode int string<br>
The first parameter is how far you want to unshift your string 1-25; The second is the plaintext you want to decode<br>
crack string
Pass in an encoded string that you want to be cracked. (Will not work for very short strings or strings that have an irregular amount of rare letters ie.) "pizza" , "Kazoots, I love xylophones" )
